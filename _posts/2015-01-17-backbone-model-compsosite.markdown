I'm happy to announce Backbone Model Composite, a small `Backbone.Model` extension which 
supports nested models, and provides intuitive event propagation.

For more info, see the [project page](http://samolsen.github.io/backbone-model-composite/)
and [annotated source](http://samolsen.github.io/backbone-model-composite/docs/backbone-model-composite.html).
